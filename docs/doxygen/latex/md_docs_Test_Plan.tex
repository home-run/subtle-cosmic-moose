3.\+2 Tactics of Verification \& Validation

{\bfseries Verification}

{\bfseries Validation}

1 $>$Are you building it right?

$>$Are you building the right thing?

2 $>$Ensures that the software system meets all the functionality.

$>$Ensures that the functionalities meet the intended behavior.

3 $>$Verification takes place first and includes the checking for documentation, code, etc.

$>$Validation occurs after verification and mainly involves the checking of the overall product.

4 $>$Done by developers.

$>$Done by testers.

5 $>$It has static activities, as it includes collecting reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections to verify a software.

$>$It has dynamic activities, as it includes executing the software against the requirements.

6 $>$t is an objective process and no subjective decision should be needed to verify a software.

$>$It is a subjective process and involves subjective decisions on how well a software works.

\paragraph*{4.\+1 General}


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Performance\+: Analysis of big-\/O notation
\item Persistence\+: a. Data is saved to Sqlite database and is retrieval between executions.
\item Data structure\+: a. Dijkstra\textquotesingle{}s algorithm to compute shortest distance. b. Prim\textquotesingle{}s algorithm for M\+ST. c. Splay tree to retrieve the same data. d. \hyperlink{class_heap}{Heap} to retrieve the smallest desirable data.
\item Efficiency\+: Appropriately use the correct data structure for maximum efficiency.
\item Functionality\+: a. Source code works and corresponds correctly. b. Classes, Methods/\+Functions, variables are named properly and meaningful corresponding to their desired functionality.
\item Interface\+: a. Buttons do what is intended for. b. Buttons designed for baseball fans should only be presentable to them. c. Buttons designed for administrator should only be presentable to them. d. Tables are formated correctly and words don’t overlap each other.
\item Delegate UI design a. Buttons are labeled correctly for their intended use. b. Buttons are sized appropriately and proportion to the current page. c. Color schemes are chosen carefully so widgets/buttons/backgrounds are clearly presentable. d. Use of too many unrelated colors are discouraged.
