$>$A list of all major league baseball stadiums resides at \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Major_League_Baseball_stadiums}{\tt http\+://en.\+wikipedia.\+org/wiki/\+List\+\_\+of\+\_\+\+Major\+\_\+\+League\+\_\+\+Baseball\+\_\+stadiums}. A list of all the major league baseball teams reside at \href{http://mlb.com}{\tt http\+://mlb.\+com}. Your software team is to write a program that stores this data in a suitable data structure. (map, vector, list, heap, B\+ST, tree, etc.) Your application will allow baseball fans to plan their dream vacation.

The initial souvenir list is a follows\+:

a. Baseball cap \$23.\+99 b. Baseball bat \$45.\+39 c. Team pennant \$15.\+99 d. Autographed baseball \$19.\+99 e. Team jersey \$85.\+99

Requirements\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Write at least 10 agile stories (including description, tasks, test scenarios, and story points) before any software development.
\item You should create a list of the major league stadiums by name in alphabetical order.
\item You should create a list of major league stadiums sorted by team name.
\item You should create a list of American League stadiums sorted by team name.
\item You should create a list of National League stadiums sorted by team name.

\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Planning a vacation\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Design trips to visit each major league stadium travelling the shortest distance starting at Dodger stadium using Dijkstra’s algorithm (note\+: each trip begins at Dodger stadium).
\item Provide the capability for a baseball fan to plan his/her dream vacation by allowing a baseball fan to choose their starting stadium and all the other stadiums they would like to visit. Determine the order the stadiums will be visited. Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to calculate the shortest distance for this dream vacation.
\item Determine the minimum spanning tree (M\+ST) connecting all the major league stadiums using Prim’s or Kruskal’s algorithm. Calculate the associated mileage.
\item Provide the capability to track souvenirs purchased by the baseball fans on their trips and the corresponding costs.
\item Output the total revenue for each stadium including a grand total for all the stadiums.
\item Provide the ability to modify stadium information if a team moves into a new stadium. (administrator only) (Atlanta Braves are planning to move to a new stadium in 2017).
\item Provide the ability to add a new team and corresponding stadium if major league baseball decides to add new teams. (administrator only)
\item You should be able to randomly access any baseball stadium.
\item You should be able to modify (add/delete/change) the souvenirs list and their prices. (administrator only)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Please let me know your partners by March 28nd (three points will be deducted from your score if you do not meet this deadline). All projects are due by May 16th. No late projects will be accepted. Your team must demonstrate your project to me before it will be graded. Each teammate must identify their accomplishments on the project. Not all team members will necessarily earn the same score.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Design a very readable, easy to use interface to demonstrate your program.
\item Use a map to store the stadiums or the souvenirs.
\item Contingency handling should include addressing invalid input.
\item Write at least 10 agile stories (including description, tasks, test scenarios, and story points) before any software is developed. The team must follow the Scrum process (the Scrum master must document all meetings and the product owner must document the backlog).
\item Submit a U\+ML class diagram, at least three use cases, and at least three state diagrams with your project.
\item Submit a test plan.
\item All changes must be persistent between executions.
\item Submit a paragraph discussing the Big-\/\+Oh of your project. Identify all the data structures used.
\item Each team must use a version control system, graphical user interface tool, automated documentation tool, and an Agile management tool. (G\+I\+T\+H\+UB, D\+O\+X\+Y\+G\+EN, W\+A\+F\+F\+I\+O.\+IO, QT, etc.)
